This is version 0.3 of the de.vdheide.mp3 package, a library to read and write 
ID3 and ID3v2 tags and read MP3 file properties.

This release consists of three files:

java_mp3-0.3-bin.zip
	Contains the precompiled library in a jar file.
java_mp3-0.3-src.zip
	Contains the source code for the library and the test cases.
java_mp3-0.3-doc.zip
	Contains the JavaDoc documentation for the library.
	
	

Release notes
=============

This is version 0.3. Since this is only the third release, I still consider it 
alpha. But I will not change any existing public methods and classes, so the
interface stays the same even if I do some modifications to the code.

A severe bug was discovered in version 0.2 which could lead to corruption of
MP3 files when updating the ID3v2 tags. All users are advised to update to 
version 0.3.
I also used to opportunity to optimize the file copy operations. Updates to
ID3v2 tags run much faster now.

This is a pure bugfix release (see the Changelog for details), it contains no 
new features.

Documentation is only present as JavaDoc created class descriptions. I will add
some examples and overview documentation later. For now, also take a look at the
test cases contained in the source archive.


Future plans
============

First of all, more frequent releases. I will not give any precise dates, as that
depends on the amount of spare time that I can spend on this project.

Since I am not using the library myself (I dropped all plans on developing an
ID3 tagger), I depend on you to provide me with ideas for the further direction
of development. Patches and code is definitely preferred, but feature requests
and bug reports are welcome to.

I also plan on making the source code available in a public code repository
and add a mailing list for announcements and discussion.
If anyone can recommend a reliable public Subversion repository, please feel
free to contact me. Subversion only please, I do not plan to go back to CVS.


Next version
------------

The next version will be a bugfix version again. I plan on completing the test
cases and improve documentation. This version is due at the beginning of 2005.


Future versions
---------------

The next major feature will be support for ID3v2.4.0. I have not yet looked into
the standard in detail, so I cannot give you a time frame for completion.

Again, your ideas and input is welcome.
